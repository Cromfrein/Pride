# Pride
Pride is a launcher (a la https://github.com/FreaKzero/ssgl-doom-launcher)
I originally was going to have Pride simply be a folder autoconfigurer-thing for SSGL, but got a little ambitious.

# Dependencies
(soon)ncurses, my environment variable script stuff

# Module Source Repositories: 
https://github.com/dashodanger/Obsidian

That's it for extra modules currently, might add a moddb browser or something in a year or three.

# Credits:
Everyone who has ever worked on Obsidian, DOOM, and modern source ports. Seriously, yall are legends.
